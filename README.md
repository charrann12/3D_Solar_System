# 🌍 3D Solar System Simulation – Built with Three.js

This project is a 3D simulation of our Solar System, built using Three.js. It brings the planets to life with animations, textures, and interactive features

## 🌟 What’s Inside

- A glowing sun at the center
- 8 beautiful, orbiting planets with realistic motion
- A slider to control each planet’s speed
- Hover tooltips that show planet names
- Click a planet to zoom in for a closer look
- A toggle switch to switch between dark & light themes (with sun/moon icons)
- Starry background to make it feel like space
- Fully responsive – works on all screen sizes

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Make sure you have the required images inside a folder named textures:
   - earth1.jpg (Earth texture)
   - earth_specular_2048.jpg (Earth’s lighting map)
3. Also include sun.png and moon.png in the root folder.
4. Open index.html in any modern browser — and you're good to go!
